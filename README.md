<strong>An interactive grid in which the user can drag their mouse to color in grid squares. </strong>

<strong>Features:</strong>


Users are able to set the grid size, up to 100x100, select their color from an RGB color picker, clear the grid, and enable party mode(random color per cell)


<strong>Personal goals for this project:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>learn about CSS grid and combine CSS Grid with flexbox to style the page. </li>
<li>learn more about DOM manipulation and become more comfortable using event listeners. </li>
</ul>

<strong>Project in Review:</strong> 

Generating the grid was perhaps the most challenging part and I'm still not completely satisfied with it. In the future I want to change the grid generation so that the page starts with a 16X16 grid and then the user clicks to change the size, rather than beginning with the prompt. I learned a little bit about CSS Grid- in particular how to set columns and rows and how to change their size. The rest of the page was styled with flex-box. 
The party mode feature allowed me to incorporate math functions again to generate a random number. 
The color picker taught me about a kind of input I was unaware of (type: color), as well as the input event listener. 
I look forward to refactoring the code in the future!
